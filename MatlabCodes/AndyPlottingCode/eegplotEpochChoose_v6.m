function eegplotEpochChoose

%two codes that run with EEGLAB running, one to plot the data with no reject but instead save the
%selected epochs as a logical vector. Second code to make and save a new
%dataset with those epochs.
%[] need to figure out how to save the event information so visible in
%saved .set files
%
%eegplotEpochKeep created 8/24/11 with some notes in IN370 analysis
%1/6/12 modified to allow to view as Laplacian so more accurate view of
%artifact. Also change to not be in workspace so is more flexible. Tried to
%have the REJECT button run the code but the figure doesn't have access to
%EEG unless it's in the workspace so instead user needs to select all then
%press return on the keyboard.
%1/7/12 add option to load in a previous one and highlight previously
%selected epochs
%3/27/12 put in a catch to close program if already have an EEGLAB plot
%window opened since worried code will use the wrong one.
%4/16/12 added statement to transpose old selected epochs since found an
%old dataset where they were in a row vector but in newer dataset it's in a
%column vector, not sure why they changed but this fixes the issue
%4/16/12 version 2 plots the diff (as a fast LPF) accelerometer data in a
%different window so can see it easier. Problem was that the selected
%epochs need to be the correct number of channels but it doesn't see the
%accelerometer channels. Might be better all in one window but with the
%diff of the accelerometer so at least doesn't go all over the place.
%4/27/12 version 3 give option to filter the data first for easier
%visualization, doesn't change the underlying data at all.
%5/1/12 version 4 gives option to cut the data instead of keep it (so don't
%need to use the EEGLAB GUI for this purpose). Don't close figure at end. 
%Changed name from eegplotEpochKeep. Created unique tag so don't need to
%close other windows on off chance want to compare. Now runs the command by
%clicking the button in the figure, though requires using the slightly
%modified eegplotAndy rather than eegplot so doesn't run the commands
%inherent in eegplot.
%5/4/12 version 5 calls spectraGUI to create spectra of the selected (or
%non-selected) epochs using the original data.
%5/7/12 HPF now at 0.1 and will not HPF on epoched data since doesn't
%make sense, though does 60 Hz.
%5/8/12 if display previously chosen epochs, if those were cut out will
%display in red, if those were kept, will display in green.
%5/9/12 version 6 5/9/12 found bug that this was converting data to laplacian before saving,
%so later power spectra calculation was doing second laplacian which
%changed result. Also fixed bug that wasn't detecting actual continuous
%data that has been cut, so now assumes it's continuous if no date field.
%Also made code stop if two eegplot windows with same tag because it didn't
%accurately pick out the new one (luckily).
%5/12/12 Added a catch in case want to display previously cut / kept data,
%to ensure that the old data was created from the current one. 
%6/3/12 changed the version that runs on data without accelerometers to
%also use eegplotAndy rather than eegplot. This should have been fixed
%earlier.
%11/27/12 found bug where if didn't apply a filter, then it just used the
%original data, ignoring the application of the montage!
%12/2/12 found bug where if use bipolar, gave error in the chanlocs because
%bipolar chanlocs doesn't match the original one when saving. Changed code
%so that save with original chanlocs. Also changed default number of epochs
%to be approximately 10 seconds instead of 10 epochs.

%to do:
%consider filtering out high frequency artifact (>40 Hz) since want to
%differentiate EMG from beta but would need to do real time with a GUI.
%[] for previously chosen, only choose ones that are a subset of this one
