function data=MakeLaplacian(dataOriginal,channels)
%
%New version 5/17/11 that uses cofl_xtp_makemont to make laplacian montage
%dynamically. Give data organized as channels x data x trials.
%Then channels is either cell array list of channels or an EEGLAB chanlocs structure.
%Important that all channels are represented in eegp_defopts which is where
%their locations are specified.
%version 2 has new lead locations
%version 3 allows for normalization by total power, requires params.Fs at
%minimum
%version 4 11/15/11 option to run on the EGI array (initially used with
%Srvivas's data but meant for our 129 headcap too)
%version 5 12/13/11 will ignore channels not located on head (like acc).
%Determined by EEG.chanlocs.X=NaN (done in importAccEeglab and JV's
%chanlocs code). Requires chanlocs as the second input obviously.
%version 6 7/6/12 discovered that the eeglab channel location file
%(standard 2005.mat) is not symmetrical so leads to laplacians that
%are more on one side of the head or another. Will remove call to eegp_defopts_eeglablocsAndy
%([] though still used to get the EGI128 in correctly). [] Also may
%want to incorporate JV's code that reduces the EGI128 to a
%standard 10-20 set.
%version 7 11/27/12 for bringing in patient EEG from Burke from a .edf file
%where channel labels exist but no information about channel location.
%version 8 8/6/13 allow 32 channel EGI system

%note if you use a(:,:,:) for a 2 D array it works fine.

%here multiply my 3d matrix (each 3rd Dimension) by JV's Hjorth multiplier
%ensuring only channels present are ones I'm interested in.


%Hjorth matrices have the output in rows and input in columns (confirmed 5/17/11
%by having fewer outputs than inputs). You are reordering the columns of the data so it goes on the right.  So I put Hjorth
%matrix on the left and my data on the right as it is channels x data. Can't multiply by whole 3D
%matrix so need to multiply one snippet at a time.


% dataHjorthOrder=zeros(size(eegDataReordered));
% for i=1:size(eegDataReordered,3) %for each snippet
%     dataHjorthOrder(:,:,i)=Hjorth*eegDataReordered(:,:,i);
